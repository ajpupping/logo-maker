# SVG Logo Maker
A command-line application that creates a logo based on user input. 

## Description 
The goal of this project was to create a command line application which takes in user input to generate an SVG logo.  The secondary goal was to use Jest to test the functionality of the code. 

I learned how to use classes to create the different shapes, so that I can easily make modifications without changing the base code. 

## Installation 
Before using this application, enter "npm i" into the integrated terminal to install the necessary node modules. 

## Usage 
To use this command line application, enter "node index.js" into the integrated terminal and then answer the prompts. The application will generate and svg file after all of the prompts have been answered. 

## License 

This project was created for educational purposes and does not have a license. 

## Credits 

I used [this guide](https://gist.github.com/lmcneel/45594e550a3403d589bdcaad38138a83) to remove node modules that were added by mistake. 

I used [this guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) to learn about SVG images.
